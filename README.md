## About
I am sixth year PhD student at CMU working with [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) (permanently remote at San Diego).
My research focuses on modeling numerical quantities in unstructured texts, tables, long documents and spreadsheets.
Further I aim to apply numerically pretrained transformers to downstream applications to extract information from unstructured climate reports.
Previously, I studied computer science at the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara.

## Professional Experience
- Research Intern, Salesforce Research, Palo Alto Summer 2022 
    - Defined a new numerical comprehension task of predicting the correlation relationship of quantities in text. Used crowd-workers to label and release a new dataset for this task.

- Research Project, Boeing, 2021
    + Worked on a task of email thread summarization. Along with engineers and technicians we collected a dataset, implemented several pretraining strategies and evaluated the performance of the models.
    
- Research Intern, Microsoft Research, Virtual Summer 2020
    - As a part of the MSR's Deep-Excel team, worked on designing and training neural transformer architectures on self-supervised tasks using excel spreadsheet data and then finetuning the models for various downstream tasks.

- Research Intern, Google AI, Mountain View Summer 2019
    - As a part of Google Search's Web Answers team, developed and experimented with numerical regression pretraining and transfer learning methods to improve accuracy for a downstream question answering task.

## Volunteer
- Core Member at [Climate Change AI](https://www.climatechange.ai/)
    - Climate Change AI is a non-profit that organizes academic workshops, distributes grants, and partners with other organizations to promote the use of AI for climate change. I have helped organize a virtual two week long summer school this past year with 80+ participants and over 20+ hours of new content on climate change and AI.
