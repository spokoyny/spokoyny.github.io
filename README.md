## About
I am fourth year PhD student at CMU working with [Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~tberg/) (permanently remote at San Diego).
I am interested in modeling numerical quantities in text, tables, long documents and spreadsheets.
Previously, I studied computer science at the College of Creative Studies at UC Santa Barbara.
